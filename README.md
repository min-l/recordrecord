made this very quickly for my dad so he can relatively easily convert recordings of vinyl to a digital format and tag it nicely.
## still to do
- check discogs for cd versions of the same album that will have track lengths on to recommend splits better
- move created files to a seperate folder maybe
- allow user to select the start of the first track so it doesn't have to be neatly cut to start and end of the album.
